# MASTER TRADING KNOWLEDGE — SPY/SPX/Saty/Milkman

Generated: 2026-04-24/25  
Primary purpose: compact, source-traceable operating knowledge for future SPY/SPX analysis.  
Scope rule from Mr. Pedro: **Satyland individual trade reviews were excluded**. Satyland is used only for foundational concepts, indicator topics, canonical vocabulary, and general setup doctrine.

This document is research support, not financial advice. Statistics are historical SPY backtests and extracted doctrine; they are not certainties.

## 0. Hermes live-trading operating rules

When asked to analyze SPX/SPY, use this sequence:

1. **State the product and timeframe**: SPX/SPY/ES, RTH vs premarket, 1m/3m/10m/1h/4h/daily context.
2. **Separate facts from thesis**:
   - Facts: price relative to PDC, ATR grid, VWAP, ribbon/EMA stack, PO state, compression, time of day.
   - Thesis: likely path, active setup, directional bias.
3. **Use if/then plans, not predictions**:
   - If price reclaims/holds X, target Y.
   - If price loses/closes through X, thesis invalidates.
4. **Always name**:
   - Setup
   - Preconditions
   - Entry trigger
   - Invalidation
   - Target ladder
   - Confidence / caveats
5. **Never treat an edge as certainty**. A 70–90% historical stat still fails.
6. **Prefer level-to-level thinking**. The system is built around hops through ATR levels, not one-shot full-ATR predictions.
7. **Respect time decay**. Early RTH triggers are much higher quality than late-day triggers, especially bullish Golden Gates.
8. **Mark stats vs doctrine**:
   - Backtested stats: from `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md`, `/root/spy/KNOWLEDGE.md`, `/root/spy/README.md`.
   - Saty doctrine: from `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md` and foundational concept JSON.

## 1. Vocabulary and notation

### Products

- **SPX**: S&P 500 cash index; cash-settled options; often used for 0DTE/1DTE premium trades.
- **SPY**: S&P 500 ETF; underlying for the 25-year backtests in `/root/spy`.
- **ES / /ES**: S&P futures; useful for overnight/premarket context.
- **QQQ / NDX / /NQ**: Nasdaq variants.
- **IWM / RUT**: Russell variants.
- **VIX / VVIX / VX**: volatility context.

### Session/time terms

- **Premarket**: 4:00–9:30 ET.
- **RTH**: 9:30–16:00 ET.
- **Opening range**: first 5m or 10m of RTH.
- **Power hour**: 15:00–16:00 ET.
- **OpEx / weekly / monthly / quad witching**: option-expiration context.
- **0DTE / 1DTE**: days to expiration.

### ATR level notation

- **PDC / central pivot / previous close**: zero-line for daily ATR levels.
- **Trigger**: ±23.6% ATR from previous close. Upper = call trigger. Lower = put trigger.
- **Golden Gate entry / GG open**: ±38.2% ATR. The Golden Gate **opens** here.
- **Midrange**: ±50% ATR.

## 2. Core Saty indicators

### 2.1 Saty ATR Levels

**Definition:** ATR-based Fibonacci grid using the previous period close and the 14-period ATR from a higher timeframe. Day mode uses daily ATR, multiday uses weekly, swing uses monthly, position uses quarterly, long-term uses yearly. [Source: `/root/spy/KNOWLEDGE.md#indicator-1-saty-atr-levels`]

**Key levels:**

| Level | Distance from previous close | Live-use meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| Trigger | ±23.6% ATR | First long/short trigger zone |
| GG entry / GG open | ±38.2% ATR | Golden Gate opens |
| Midrange | ±50% ATR | Intermediate target; watch R:R |
| GG completion / Golden Fib | ±61.8% ATR | Main Golden Gate target |
| Full ATR | ±100% ATR | Large daily move; cumulative probability low |
| Extensions | ±123.6%, ±161.8%, ±200% | Momentum extension zones |

**Implementation notes:**

- ATR uses Wilder/RMA smoothing, not SMA: `ewm(alpha=1/period, adjust=False)`.
- Intraday ATR tables use daily ATR reference, matching TradingView `request.security(ticker, 'D', ta.atr(14))` behavior.
- Daily/weekly candles use RTH data only.
- Bad tick clipping caps bar wicks at 2% beyond the candle body to remove phantom prints while preserving real volatility.

[Source: `/root/spy/KNOWLEDGE.md#implementation-notes--validation-results`]

**Operating rule:** use the ATR grid as support/resistance and target ladder. Do not jump straight from PDC to full ATR unless the setup supports it.

### 2.2 Saty Pivot Ribbon Pro

**Definition:** multi-layer EMA cloud/ribbon system showing trend structure, pullback zones, compression candles, and conviction signals. [Source: `/root/spy/KNOWLEDGE.md#indicator-2-saty-pivot-ribbon-pro`]

**EMA layers:**

| EMA | Role |
|---:|---|
| 8 | Fast EMA; short-term trend/pullback reference |
| 13 | Pullback overlap EMA; used in slow cloud variant and Vomy/iVomy logic |
| 21 | Pivot EMA; core trend reference |
| 34 | Often used as stop/reference in Saty trade examples |
| 48 | Slow EMA; major trend/cloud reference |
| 200 | Long-term trend anchor |

**Cloud/ribbon reading:**

- Fast cloud: EMA 8 vs EMA 21; green when 8 ≥ 21, red when 8 < 21.
- Slow cloud: EMA 13/48 or 21/48; blue/aqua bullish, orange bearish.
- Ribbon flip: fast cloud changes color; potential trend change.
- Conviction arrows: 13/48 EMA cross, slower but higher-confidence trend confirmation.
- Candle bias:
  - Green: up candle above EMA48.
  - Red: down candle below EMA48.
  - Blue: down candle above EMA48 = pullback in bullish trend.
  - Orange: up candle below EMA48 = bounce in bearish trend.
  - Gray/violet: compression candles.

**Saty doctrine:** trade with the trend; wait for confirmation; do not chase; prefer pullback-to-ribbon entries; avoid sideways/entangled ribbons. [Sources: `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md`; `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/trend-mantra.json`; `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/pivot-ribbon.json`]

### 2.3 Saty Phase Oscillator

**Definition:** range-normalized momentum oscillator measuring distance from EMA21, normalized by ATR. [Source: `/root/spy/KNOWLEDGE.md#indicator-3-saty-phase-oscillator`]

Formula:

```text
raw_signal = ((price - EMA21) / (3 * ATR14)) * 100
oscillator = EMA(raw_signal, 3)
```

**Zones:**

| Zone | Range | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| Extended Up | > +100 | Overbought extreme |
| Distribution | +61.8 to +100 | Potential topping/profit-taking zone |
| Neutral Up | +23.6 to +61.8 | Healthy uptrend territory |
| Neutral | -23.6 to +23.6 | No clear momentum |
| Neutral Down | -61.8 to -23.6 | Healthy downtrend territory |
| Accumulation | -100 to -61.8 | Potential bottoming zone |
| Extended Down | < -100 | Oversold extreme |

**Signals:**

- Leaving accumulation: crosses above -61.8; potential long/reversal.
- Leaving distribution: crosses below +61.8; potential short/take-profit.
- Leaving extreme down: crosses above -100; strong reversal signal.
- Leaving extreme up: crosses below +100; strong reversal signal.
- Rising/falling state matters; high+rising vs high+falling and low+falling vs low+rising can change GG odds.

**Caveat:** 60m PO has a known accuracy gap versus TradingView because extended-hours data inflates hourly ATR; 10m PO accuracy is much better. Still, 60m PO was more predictive in the historical Bilbo GG tests; treat this as useful but audit-sensitive. [Sources: `/root/spy/KNOWLEDGE.md#validated-against-tradingview-export`; `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#4-10m-vs-60m-phase-oscillator`]

### 2.4 Compression / Squeeze

Compression is detected when Bollinger Band width is small relative to ATR:

- BB width = `2 * stdev(21)`.
- Compression active when BB width < `2 * ATR(14)`.
- Expansion confirmed when BB width grows and exceeds about `1.854 * ATR` threshold.

Satyland glossary also maps Squeeze/Squeeze Pro:

- Red dots = squeeze on.
- Green dots = squeeze fired.
- Pro intensity colors: black/narrow, red/normal, orange/wide, green/fired.
- “5–10 dots” is a heuristic for enough compression to matter.

[Sources: `/root/spy/KNOWLEDGE.md#bollinger-band-compression`; `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md`]

### 2.5 VWAP, RAF, volume, VIX, gamma

Use these as context/confluence, not as standalone rules unless the setup requires them:

- **VWAP**: intraday volume-weighted mean; useful for ORB, mean reversion, and institutional trend context.
- **Ready Aim Fire Pro / RAF**: signal dashboard; conviction arrow is tied to the 13/48 confirmation concept.
- **Volume oscillator**: volume momentum; declining volume + wicks can mark exhaustion.
- **VIX key levels**: volatility regime/context.
- **Gamma levels**: possible pin/resistance/support zones around OpEx and large strikes.

[Source: `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md`]

## 3. Daily market preparation framework

Before evaluating a trade, build the morning/context map:

1. **Higher timeframe context**
   - Daily trend: price vs daily 21 EMA, daily PO zone/rising/falling.
   - 4h PO: extended/distribution/accumulation/rollover.
   - 1h PO: especially for Bilbo GG and call→put reversal filters.
   - 10m ribbon: trend/sideways/compression.
2. **Levels**
   - PDC / previous close.
   - Daily call/put triggers (±23.6%).
   - Daily GG open levels (±38.2%).
   - Daily 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%, full ATR.
   - Premarket high/low.
   - Opening range high/low after 5m/10m.
   - VWAP.
   - Support/resistance and supply/demand zones.
3. **Regime**
   - Trend day: ribbon stacked, pullbacks hold.
   - Compression: squeeze/box forming; wait for expansion direction.
   - Chop: price around PDC/VWAP, entangled ribbon; avoid or use credit/income logic.
   - Event/expiration: OpEx, CPI/Fed, quad witching, gamma/pin context.
4. **Primary setup map**
   - Do not chase random candles. Identify which setup is active.
   - If no primary setup is active, do nothing.

Saty doctrine: identify market condition first, then apply the matching primary setup; “FOMO is stupid.” Doing nothing is often the best course. [Sources: `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/primary-setups.json`; `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/discipline.json`; `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/morning-plan.json`]

---

## 4. Primary setup map

### Trend continuation

- Golden Gate continuation.
- Bilbo Golden Gate.
- ORB continuation.
- Vomy/iVomy ribbon continuation.
- Pivot/ribbon pullback.

### Breakout / expansion

- Trigger break and hold.
- 10m compression → expansion.
- Bilbo Box break.
- Opening range break.
- Resistance/support break and retest.

### Mean reversion

- ±1 ATR RTM.
- Gap fill / midpoint fill.
- Price vs daily 21 EMA extreme reversion.
- 4h PO leaving extreme/distribution/accumulation.
- TICK fading at extreme readings.

### Reversal/exhaustion

- Call trigger → put trigger morning reversal.
- 4h PO rollover + OpEx window.
- Bull/bear divergences.
- Failed breakout.
- H pattern / Head & Shoulders / wedges / Wyckoff.

### Income / credit spread

- Trigger Box held for 30m/1h and selling opposite-side spreads at ±61.8 or ±100.
- Avoid spread structures when trend/volatility can quickly invalidate the box.

---

## 5. Golden Gate system

### 5.1 Definition and mechanics

The Golden Gate is the path from ±38.2% ATR to ±61.8% ATR:

- Bull GG opens when price reaches +38.2% ATR.
- Bull GG completes when price reaches +61.8% ATR.
- Bear GG opens when price reaches -38.2% ATR.
- Bear GG completes when price reaches -61.8% ATR.

Ideal doctrine: clear trend, EMAs stacked in the direction of the move, and entry at/near the ribbon if possible. Take profit at the 61.8 level / Golden Fib. [Sources: `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/golden-gate.json`; `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md`]

### 5.2 Level-to-level probabilities

Day-mode, within the same day:

| Move | Historical probability |
|---|---:|
| Close → ±Trigger | 99.2% in either direction in study reference; README/older doc also cites 80% in a different level-to-level framing |
| Trigger → ±38.2% | 80% conditional |
| 38.2% → 61.8% | 69% |
| 61.8% → 78.6% | 60% |
| 78.6% → full ATR | 55% |
| Close → full ATR cumulative | 14% |
| Bull GG baseline completion | 63.0% (n=3,411) |
| Bear GG baseline completion | 65.0% (n=3,200) |

Use the latest compact study reference for live decisions: Trigger→38.2 = 80%, 38.2→61.8 = 69%, full ATR cumulative = 14%. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#1-level-to-level-probabilities-day-mode-within-same-day`]

### 5.3 Bilbo Golden Gate: 1h PO filter

The 60-minute Phase Oscillator filter materially changes GG completion odds.

Bull GG completion by 1h PO state:

| 1h PO state | Completion |
|---|---:|
| High + Rising | 77.7% (n=372) |
| High + Falling | 77.6% (n=107) |
| Mid + Rising | 63.3% (n=2,256) |
| Mid + Falling | 51.5% (n=664) |
| Baseline | 63.0% |

Bear GG completion by 1h PO state:

| 1h PO state | Completion |
|---|---:|
| Low + Falling | 90.2% (n=265) |
| Low + Rising | 88.5% (n=96) |
| Mid + Falling | 64.0% (n=2,203) |
| Mid + Rising | 54.2% (n=626) |
| Baseline | 65.0% |

Continuation beyond 61.8:

- Bull PO High+Rising: 61.8 = 77.7%, 78.6 = 58.9%, 100 = 39.2%, 123.6 = 23.7%.
- Bull baseline: 61.8 = 63%, 78.6 = 42.7%, 100 = 25.5%, 123.6 = 12.7%.
- Bear PO Low+Falling: 61.8 = 90.2%, 78.6 = 80%, 100 = 66%, 123.6 = 43.8%.
- Bear baseline: 61.8 = 65%, 78.6 = 48.1%, 100 = 31.4%, 123.6 = 18.3%.

Key: bearish Bilbo is the strongest intraday directional configuration; it had 66% full-ATR reach in the study, higher than baseline GG completion itself. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#2-bilbo-golden-gate-conditioned-on-1-hour-phase-oscillator`]

**Audit caveat:** the unified KB flags some Bilbo GG claims as `needs_code_fix` because one script may not have selected all 61.8 columns before using them. Preserve the stat, but do not oversell it without checking reruns if money/risk depends on precision. [Source: `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/bilbo-golden-gate.json`]

### 5.4 10m vs 60m PO

For GG completion, the 60m PO was 5–12x more predictive than the 10m PO:

- Bull edge: 60m +14.7pp over baseline; 10m only +3.1pp.
- Bear edge: 60m +25.2pp; 10m only +2.1pp.

Use 60m PO for Bilbo setups, with the hourly TradingView/data caveat noted. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#4-10m-vs-60m-phase-oscillator`]

### 5.5 Entry optimization

| Entry method | Result / interpretation |
|---|---|
| Immediate at 38.2 | 63–65% completion, +10% ATR EV; appears on all GG days |
| 10m EMA8 pullback | 62–63%, +10–12% EV; appears 97% |
| 10m EMA21 pullback | 58%, +8% EV; appears 88% |
| 1h EMA21 pullback | 42%, +7–9% EV; appears 57–62%; best R:R 2.3–3.2x |
| 50% midpoint | 60%, negative EV (-3%); reward too small vs risk |
| Trigger pullback | 43–48% completion but 38.2% ATR reward |

Saty doctrine favors entries at ribbon pullbacks when possible; the backtest says immediate and EMA8/EMA21 pullbacks have similar hit rates, while deeper 1h EMA21 pullbacks have better R:R but lower completion. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#5-gg-entry-optimization`]

### 5.6 Invalidation

The trigger (23.6%) is the key stop/kill level once GG is active:

- Trigger holds: 84–89% GG completion.
- 10m close back through trigger: 45–51% completion.
- Delta: -39pp; strongest level-based invalidation signal.

Other warnings:

- 1h EMA21 break: -20 to -28pp delta.
- 10m EMA48 break: -18 to -20pp delta.
- 10m EMA21 break: only -6pp, weaker.
- 10m EMA8 break: noise.

Operational rule: if in a GG trade, a 10m close back through trigger is a major de-risk/cut signal. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#6-gg-pullback-invalidation-when-to-cut`]

### 5.7 Timing / Subway

GG completion by trigger hour:

| Trigger time | Bull GG completion | Bear GG completion |
|---|---:|---:|
| Open | 86% | 88% |
| 09:30 | 63% | 64% |
| 10:00 | 57% | 60% |
| 11:00 | 55% | 56% |
| 12:00 | 48% | 56% |
| 13:00 | 39% | 56% |
| 14:00 | 41% | 48% |
| 15:00 | 16% | 30% |

Key: open triggers are highest conviction; bearish GGs remain more viable later than bullish; late bullish triggers are weak. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#7-subway-timing-gg-completion-by-trigger-hour`]

---

## 6. Trigger Box system

### 6.1 Definition

A trigger box day opens between PDC and a trigger:

- **Bearish trigger box**: open below PDC but above put trigger. Occurs 22.6% of days (n=1,462).
- **Bullish trigger box**: open above PDC but below call trigger. Occurs 26.3% of days (n=1,698).

[Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#8-trigger-box`]

Saty doctrine: in a trend, break of call trigger can justify calls; break of put trigger can justify puts; stops can be just below/above the trigger; scale at midrange and ±1 ATR. 2–4 DTE on SPY was noted as a preference in the extracted doctrine. [Source: `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/trigger-box.json`]

### 6.2 Hold-time implications

GG open rates / day outcome once the box holds:

| Condition | Bull GG open | Bear GG open |
|---|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 57.3% | 59.0% |
| Box held 30m | 72.6% | 71.6% |
| Box held 1h | 82.2% | 80.2% |

If GG has not triggered after hold:

- After 30m: 59–62% still trigger later.
- After 1h: 55–60%.
- After 2h: ~50% coin flip.
- After 2.5h: below 50% for bullish.
- After 5h / 2:30 PM: effectively over (~25–31%).

When PDC is reclaimed in first hour:

- 73% reach opposite trigger.
- 49% reach opposite GG entry (38.2%).

[Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#8-trigger-box`]

### 6.3 Trigger Box credit spreads

Win rate here means price does **not** reach the sold-side target level.

Sell call spreads from bearish box:

| Condition | +38.2 | +61.8 | +100 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| All days | 66.6% | 84.6% | 96.1% |
| Held 30m | 79.7% | 90.6% | 97.8% |
| Held 1h | 85.8% | 93.6% | 98.7% |

Sell put spreads from bullish box:

| Condition | -38.2 | -61.8 | -100 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| All days | 64.8% | 79.9% | 92.6% |
| Held 30m | 76.0% | 87.7% | 96.0% |
| Held 1h | 82.6% | 92.0% | 97.5% |

Two approaches:

- ±100: 97–99% win, lower premium.
- ±61.8: 88–93% win, more premium but worse loss ratio.

Use ±38.2 as stop concept. Setup fires ~10% of trading days. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#9-trigger-box-credit-spreads`]

---

## 7. Call trigger confirmation and call→put reversal

### 7.1 Call trigger confirmation

Setup: open inside trigger box, then first 3-minute close above the call trigger. Target: +38.2% ATR.

Universe:

- 49.4% of days open inside the box.
- 62.3% of those get a confirmed trigger close.

Outcomes:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Overall hit rate | 73.8% (1,496 / 2,027) |
| Clean run hit rate, no close back below trigger | 97.1% (747 / 769) |
| Invalidated hit rate, closed back below trigger | 59.5% (749 / 1,258) |
| Edge from invalidation filter | +37.6pp |
| Median time to target | 18 minutes / 6 bars |

By time:

- 09:30 trigger: 81.4% hit.
- 10:00: 76.2%.
- 10:30: 73.0%.
- 11:00: 73.3%.
- 14:00: 74.0%.
- 15:30: 29.1%.

Key: a 3-minute close back below the trigger is a powerful kill signal; clean trades before 14:00 were near-100% in this study. [Source: `/root/spy/KNOWLEDGE.md#4-call-trigger-confirmation--3-minute-close-study`]

### 7.2 Call trigger → put trigger morning reversal

Setup: SPY reaches daily call trigger before noon, later crosses below PDC, then reaches daily put trigger before noon. Outcomes measured from put-trigger touch through RTH close.

| Outcome after put trigger | Rate |
|---|---:|
| Back to PDC | 73.7% |
| Back to call trigger | 43.3% |
| Downside GG opens (-38.2%) | 75.3% |
| Downside GG completes (-61.8%) | 43.6% |
| Reaches -1 ATR | 18.5% |

1h PO filter at put-trigger touch:

| 1h state | PDC recovery | Downside GG open | GG complete | -1 ATR | Close below put |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Bullish expansion | 77.7% | 69.6% | 32.4% | 14.2% | 34.5% |
| Compression | 67.1% | 75.8% | 46.8% | 19.6% | 44.7% |
| Bearish expansion | 82.8% | 79.3% | 47.1% | 20.1% | 40.2% |

Interpretation:

- This reversal often creates both a PDC recovery and downside GG open; do not force a single clean outcome.
- PDC mean reversion is much more reliable than a full move back to call trigger.
- Hourly PO compression is the most bearish filter: lowest PDC recovery and highest close-below-put rate.
- Bullish hourly expansion suppresses downside continuation.

## 8. Gap framework

### 8.1 Concepts

- Gap fill: price returns to prior close.
- Midpoint fill: price reaches halfway back through the gap.
- Small gaps are more likely to fill quickly.
- Counter-trend gaps fill faster than pro-trend gaps.

[Sources: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#10-gap-fill-midpoint-fill--price-reaches-halfway-back-through-gap`; `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/gap-fill.json`]

### 8.2 Midpoint fill rates

Gap up midpoint fill rates day 1:

| Gap size | All | EMA21 bearish | EMA21 bullish |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| <0.25% | 94% | 99% | 93% |
| 0.25–0.5% | 83% | 96% | 77% |
| 0.5–1% | 73% | 85% | 66% |
| 1–2% | 57% | 67% | 49% |
| 2%+ | 62% | 68% | 57% |

Gap down midpoint fill rates:

| Gap size | All | EMA21 bearish | EMA21 bullish |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| <0.25% | 95% | 92% | 96% |
| 0.25–0.5% | 88% | 84% | 91% |
| 0.5–1% | 77% | 71% | 86% |
| 1–2% | 70% | 66% | 80% |

Key: tiny gaps (<0.25%) are near-certain midpoint fills; counter-trend gaps fill faster; large gap-ups in compression plus bull trend resist filling. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#10-gap-fill-midpoint-fill--price-reaches-halfway-back-through-gap`]

### 8.3 Operational use

Use gaps as a contextual magnet, not an automatic trade:

- If gap is small and counter-trend, gap/midpoint fill can be primary target.
- If gap is pro-trend and ribbon/PO support continuation, avoid fading too early.
- Combine gap target with PDC, VWAP, premarket high/low, and ATR levels.
- If price rejects a supply/demand zone and gap remains below/above, gap fill becomes a target; scale at intermediate support/resistance.

## 9. Compression / expansion / Bilbo Box

### 9.1 10m compression → expansion

Setup: 10m PO enters compression / Bollinger squeeze for at least 30 minutes. Expansion direction is measured from compression range midpoint over 120 minutes after expansion.

Total events: 6,116; 3,311 bullish and 2,805 bearish. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#13-10-minute-compression--expansion`]

Baseline:

- 54.1% bullish expansions; 45.9% bearish.
- Expansion direction correct 91% of the time, measured by max profit > max drawdown.
- Bullish mean profit 0.58%, mean net +0.31%.
- Bearish mean profit 0.69%, mean net +0.35%.

EMA 21/48 trend predicts direction:

| Compression duration | 21>48 → Bull% | 21<48 → Bull% | Edge |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 30–50m | 63.5% | 42.5% | +21pp |
| 60–110m | 68.2% | 34.8% | +33pp |
| 120–170m | 78.6% | 30.2% | +48pp |
| 180m+ | 83.7% | 22.9% | +61pp |

Compression length increases reliability:

| Duration | N | Mean profit | Net > 0 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 30–50m | 1,795 | 0.607% | 76.1% |
| 60–110m | 2,256 | 0.625% | 81.4% |
| 120–170m | 1,119 | 0.640% | 83.6% |
| 180m+ | 946 | 0.680% | 86.2% |

ATR position at expansion:

- Above +61.8%: 91% bullish.
- Trigger–38.2%: 81% bullish.
- Bull trigger box: 67% bullish.
- Bear trigger box: 38% bullish / 62% bearish.
- Below -61.8%: 89% bearish.

Operational rule: long compression + aligned EMA21/48 + supportive ATR position = strong directional clue. Time of day matters less than trend and ATR position. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#13-10-minute-compression--expansion`]

### 9.2 Bilbo Box breakout

Definition: Bilbo Box is the range of the first 5 compression bars. Once the box locks, break-watch begins; price trading outside the range is the break. Tested variants:

- Immediate at boundary.
- Close-outside confirmation.
- Retest.

Sample: 50,889 break events across 3m/10m/1h/4h/1d, 2000–2026. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#15-bilbo-box-breakout`]

10-bar Net-R median:

| TF | N | Immediate | Close | Retest |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3m | 32,041 | +0.03 | -0.04 | -0.07 |
| 10m | 7,656 | +0.03 | -0.02 | -0.08 |
| 1h | 3,399 | +0.04 | 0.00 | -0.02 |
| 4h | 936 | +0.03 | +0.05 | -0.01 |
| 1d | 279 | +0.06 | +0.09 | 0.00 |

Takeaways:

1. Take the break; do not wait for retest. Retest underperforms everywhere.
2. Do not wait for textbook 5-bar formation; 1–4 bar boxes carried more edge than full 5-bar boxes on intraday frames.
3. Higher timeframes favor bull side; shorting daily compression breaks was negative expectation due to SPY upward drift.
4. Stops at opposite boundary; realistic TP 0.5–1.0R.
5. Raw signal is texture, not a standalone exploit: ~51% hit rate, +0.03R median. Stack with trend/time/volatility filters.

Caveats: 1h PO/data issue; 1d sample underpowered; ambiguous outside bars excluded. [Source: `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#15-bilbo-box-breakout`]

#### 9.2.1 Bilbo Box × higher-timeframe Phase Oscillator refinement

Refined studies: HTF PO joins are lookahead-safe (`merge_asof` after shifting HTF timestamps forward by one full bar). The original fixed-window R study is now exploratory only. The actionable rebuild uses Pedro's corrected bracket exits: R = **box height** (`box_high - box_low` price range), not time width; T1 = 0.5R, T2 = 1R, T3 = 2R; stop = opposite box side; time stop = 15 bars; same-bar target/stop ambiguity waits for candle close instead of stop-first. [Sources: `/root/spy/backtest_bilbo_box_htf_po_exits.py`; `/root/spy/analyst/bilbo_box_htf_po_exits_summary.json`; `/root/spy/analyst/studies_reference.md#16a-bilbo-box--higher-timeframe-po--bracket-exit-rebuild`; `https://milkmantrades.com/bilbo-htf-po.html`]

Original fixed-window headline, now superseded for trading decisions: **same-direction PO expansion did not improve Bilbo outcomes**.

| Cut | N | Net-R median | Net+% | Stop% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3m bull baseline | 16,642 | +0.049 | 51.5% | 32.7% |
| 3m bull + 10m `bull_exp` | 4,849 | +0.042 | 51.1% | 33.4% |
| 10m bear baseline | 3,691 | -0.012 | 49.2% | 28.7% |
| 10m bear + 1h `bear_exp` | 1,067 | -0.024 | 49.1% | 28.8% |

Bracket-exit rebuild headline:

| Cohort | N | T1 0.5H | T2 1H | T3 2H | Stop | Timeout |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3m bull baseline | 18,067 | 62.4% | 38.7% | 14.0% | 37.6% | 48.4% |
| 3m bull + 10m compression | 8,752 | 61.9% | 38.0% | 13.1% | 36.7% | 50.2% |
| 3m bull + 10m low zone | 612 | 60.3% | 34.6% | 11.6% | 43.5% | 44.9% |
| 10m bear baseline | 5,224 | 59.3% | 36.4% | 14.6% | 29.8% | 55.6% |
| 10m bear + 1h compression | 2,304 | 60.5% | 38.1% | 16.3% | 29.3% | 54.4% |
| 10m bear + 1h compression+falling | 1,399 | 62.3% | 38.5% | 16.9% | 26.8% | 56.3% |
| 10m bear + 1h bull_exp+rising | 411 | 53.0% | 32.1% | 11.9% | 32.1% | 56.0% |

3-contract same-direction PO-confirmed P&L model (3 contracts; one off at T1/T2/T3; no stop move after T1; after T2 final-contract stop moves to the break-side box edge — box top for bull breaks, box bottom for bear breaks; P&L in SPY points summed across contracts):

| Strategy bucket | Trades | T1 | T2 | T3 | Stops | Timeouts | Win% | Total P&L pts | Avg/trade |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3m bull + 10m bull_exp+rising | 2,419 | 1,525 (63.0%) | 951 (39.3%) | 327 (13.5%) | 1,031 (42.6%) | 1,061 (43.9%) | 57.1% | +161.8 | +0.067 |
| 10m bear + 1h bear_exp+falling | 715 | 428 (59.9%) | 251 (35.1%) | 80 (11.2%) | 252 (35.2%) | 383 (53.6%) | 55.4% | +51.4 | +0.072 |

Operational refinement:

1. Do **not** use same-direction PO expansion as a green-light by itself; it mostly reduces sample without improving edge.
2. Use HTF PO as an **anti-filter**:
   - Skip 3m bull Bilbo breaks when 10m PO is in low/accumulation: n=572, Net-R median -0.079, Net+ 47.4%, Stop 38.3%.
   - Skip 10m bear Bilbo breaks when 1h PO is `bull_exp+rising`: n=266, Net-R median -0.172, Net+ 43.6%, Stop 33.8%.
3. Under the bracket-exit rebuild, **10m bear + 1h compression** survived modestly as constructive (T2 38.1% vs 36.4% baseline; stop 29.3% vs 29.8%); the cleaner sub-bucket is `compression+falling` (T2 38.5%, stop 26.8%).
4. Under bracket exits, **3m bull + 10m compression is not a green-light**: it lowers stops slightly but also lowers T2/T3 hit rates. The stronger 3m use remains anti-filtering low-zone 10m PO.
5. Same-direction PO confirmation with trade management is slightly positive in points (`bull_exp+rising` for 3m bull, `bear_exp+falling` for 10m bear), but the edge is modest (+0.063 and +0.096 SPY points/trade respectively).
6. For future Bilbo studies, lead with N, T1/T2/T3 hit %, stop %, timeout %, and median bars; keep fixed-window R as secondary texture only.

Caveat: the 10m PO cut is cleaner; the 1h PO cut inherits the known wick-clip-era 1h PO accuracy gap versus TradingView, so use 1h state/zone directionally, not tick-for-tick.

## 10. Mean reversion systems

### 10.1 ±1 ATR RTM

Saty doctrine: RTM / return-to-mean works around ±1 ATR extremes, Phase Oscillator extremes, ribbon distance, and exhaustion. It is both-directional and should be paired with context, not blindly faded. [Sources: `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md`; `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/rtm-1atr.json`]

Operational pattern:

- Identify extension into ±1 ATR / extended PO / far-from-ribbon condition.
- Look for exhaustion: wicks, declining volume, squeeze fired at extreme, PO curling/leaving extreme.
- Prefer reversal back toward nearer ATR levels, VWAP, EMA/ribbon, or PDC rather than demanding full reversal.
- If trend is strong and ribbon remains clean, a ±1 ATR touch may become continuation, not reversion.
- Manage quickly; lotto/no-stop examples exist in Satyland, but for systematic use define invalidation.

### 10.2 Price vs daily 21 EMA reversion

Absolute extremes over 25 years:

- Max above daily EMA21: +7.21%.
- Max below: -18.53%.
- Median: +0.68%; SPY naturally rests slightly above EMA21.
- 83.7% of days close within ±2% of EMA21.

Mean reversion by deviation:

| Deviation | 1d | 5d | 10d | 20d |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| > +5% | -0.73% | -0.88% | -0.58% | +0.43% |
| < -5% | +0.24% | +0.78% | +0.97% | +3.31% |
| < -7% | +0.50% | +1.75% | +2.64% | +5.36% |

>4% above EMA21 zone:

- 50 episodes.
- 100% touched EMA21 within 28 days; median 8 days.
- Peak day forward returns: 1d -0.83%, 3d -1.02%.
- Practical signal: 4h PO declining while daily PO still rising (n=38): 1d -0.42%, 2d -0.81%, 3d -0.85%.
- Strongest signal: 4h PO big drop delta < -10 (n=7): 1d -1.64%, 2d -1.29%.

[Source: `/root/spy/KNOWLEDGE.md#5-price-vs-daily-21-ema--reversion-study`]

### 10.3 4h PO rollover + OpEx window

Signal: 4h PO peak ≥80, then crosses below 80 (leaving distribution). Baseline sample: 118 signals over 25 years; baseline ≥1% 5d hit rate = 50.8%.

Within OpEx Friday + post-OpEx 1–5 day window:

| Horizon | N | ≥0.5% | ≥1.0% | ≥1.5% | ≥2.0% | Median |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1d | 26 | 42% | 19% | 15% | 4% | -0.40% |
| 3d | 26 | 62% | 46% | 23% | 15% | -0.95% |
| 5d | 26 | 73% | 50% | 27% | 23% | -0.99% |
| 10d | 26 | 77% | 69% | 46% | 38% | -1.37% |

Extended filter: weekly or monthly ATR position ≥0.618 (n=21): 10d horizon had 62% hit ≥1%, 43% hit ≥1.5%, 38% hit ≥2%, median -1.25%.

Takeaways:

- Edge plays over days, not necessarily immediate dump.
- OpEx Fri + post-Monday strongest pair.
- Long-dated puts preferred over weeklies when playing the tail.
- Deep extension (wk/mo ATR ≥1.0) underperforms moderate extension at 5d but has fatter left tails at 10d.

### 10.4 TICK fading

Extracted doctrine: wait until an extreme $TICK reading registers (>+1000 or <-1000), then fade the move; avoid jumping into the froth after the extreme has already hit. [Source: `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/discipline.json`]

## 11. Saty discretionary setup foundations

### 11.1 ORB — Opening Range Breakout

Definition: 5m or 10m opening range breakout/breakdown, using the opening range, VWAP, trend, and target ladder. [Sources: `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md`; `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/orb.json`]

Doctrine distilled from foundational entries:

- Identify the 5m or 10m opening range.
- Prefer a clear trend/ribbon context.
- Enter on break of the opening range or on retest of a relevant trigger/level after trend confirmation.
- In bearish ORB examples, targets included premarket low, support, and -1 ATR; scaling at each target.
- Manual stops often use 34 EMA or reclaimed trigger/level depending on setup.
- Avoid first-10-minute noise; wait for opening range definition unless the setup is specifically an open trigger/GG.

Live template:

- Preconditions: OR established; price breaking/holding outside OR; ribbon/VWAP supports direction; no major chop.
- Entry: break and hold OR high/low or retest after break.
- Invalidation: close back inside range or loss/reclaim of key EMA/trigger against trade.
- Targets: PM high/low, PDC, VWAP, ATR trigger/GG levels, support/resistance.

### 11.2 Vomy / iVomy

**Vomy**: bearish setup using Pivot Ribbon, 8/13 EMA cross/ribbon flip, squeeze/compression, Phase Oscillator, and ATR targets.  
**iVomy**: inverse/bullish version. [Source: `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md`]

Vomy doctrine:

- Clear trend preferred, often visible on 3m/10m ribbon.
- Conviction arrow / 13-48 confirmation adds confidence.
- Bear flag breakdown, lower highs/lower lows, or failed reclaim can support short thesis.
- Entry often occurs on pullback into ribbon / rejection at 8 EMA or 13 EMA, not chase.
- Invalidation can be reclaim of 13 EMA or relevant ribbon level against the short.
- Targets: put trigger, -1 ATR, support/gap fill; scale into targets.

Sources: `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/vomy.json`; `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md`]


iVomy doctrine:

- Bullish ribbon / inverse ribbon flip.
- Price holds previous close or key support.
- Entry on dip/retest into 8/13 EMA or recovery/close above 13 EMA.
- Targets: 50% ATR, 61.8% Golden Fib, prior high, call trigger/GG ladder.
- Take profit aggressively on lottos; Satyland doctrine explicitly says to take profit on lottos at 100%.

[Source: `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/ivomy.json`]

### 11.3 Support/resistance and supply/demand

Support/resistance doctrine:

- Go long at support if price pulls back and holds.
- Go short at resistance if price rallies and rejects.
- If support breaks, short the retest where old support becomes resistance.
- If resistance breaks, long the retest where old resistance becomes support.
- Scale at the next support/resistance level.

Supply/demand doctrine:

- Identify zones with multiple rejections or lower-high/lower-low structure.
- Supply + 21 EMA/ribbon resistance can define short entry.
- Invalidation is breakout through high of supply zone.
- Targets can include call/put triggers, gap fill, and nearby support.

[Sources: `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/support-resistance.json`; `/root/satyland/viewer2/kb-unified/concepts/supply-demand-zones.json`]

### 11.4 Power Play, failed breakout, divergences, patterns

Use these as secondary setup families unless current context explicitly matches them:

- **Power Play / PP**: pivot/ribbon/trend structure setup.
- **Failed breakout / FBO**: counter-trend move after breakout fails at support/resistance, often volume-confirmed.
- **Bull/Bear divergence**: PO/RSI/MACD divergence with price structure; reversal signal.
- **Bull flag / bear flag**: continuation pattern into ribbon/EMA support/resistance.
- **H Pattern, Head & Shoulders, wedges, Wyckoff**: structure/pattern context; require level confirmation.
- **Time Warp**: multi-timeframe analysis; do not mix timeframes without stating which is primary.

- Bear monthly swing GG: 33.8% day 1, 58.1% day 5, 67.9% day 10, 76.5% day 20 (n=234).
- Weekly PO adds minimal edge at monthly timeframe.
- Bearish is 3x faster than bullish on day 1.
- Monthly moves take weeks.
- Full ATR only 24% bull / 42% bear by day 20.

## 13. Trade construction playbooks

### 13.1 Day-mode Golden Gate long/short

**Preconditions**

- Price reaches ±38.2% ATR.
- Ribbon supports direction: stacked or at least not strongly opposing.
- Time of day is favorable, especially open/first hour.
- 1h PO is not counter to direction; ideal Bilbo state if available.

**Entry**

- Immediate at ±38.2; or pullback to 10m EMA8/EMA21/ribbon for improved execution.

**Invalidation**

- 10m close back through ±23.6 trigger is primary kill signal.
- 1h EMA21 or 10m EMA48 break are serious warnings.

**Targets**

- ±50% ATR partial optional.
- ±61.8% ATR primary target.
- 78.6/full ATR only when Bilbo state/trend supports continuation.

**Avoid**

- Late bullish triggers.
- Entangled/sideways ribbon.
- Midpoint entries with poor R:R unless another setup supports it.

### 13.2 Bilbo Golden Gate momentum continuation

**Preconditions**

- GG opens at 38.2.
- 1h PO state aligns:
  - Bull: high+rising or high+falling.
  - Bear: low+falling or low+rising.
- Trend/ribbon supports direction.

**Entry**

- 38.2 immediate or EMA8/ribbon pullback.

**Invalidation**

- Trigger close break.
- PO/ribbon reversal against trade.

**Targets**

- 61.8 minimum target.
- 78.6/full ATR extension more justified, especially bearish low+falling.

**Caveat**

- Audit note on some Bilbo stats; use as strong directional texture, not sole reason for oversizing.

### 13.3 Trigger Box debit/credit plan

**Debit version**

- If price breaks call trigger in bullish context, calls/longs; stop below trigger.
- If price breaks put trigger in bearish context, puts/shorts; stop above trigger.
- Scale 50% at midrange; all/mostly out at ±1 ATR except optional runner.

**Credit version**

- If bearish box holds 30–60m, consider call credit spreads above +61.8 or +100.
- If bullish box holds 30–60m, consider put credit spreads below -61.8 or -100.
- Use ±38.2 as stop/invalidating level.

### 13.4 Compression expansion breakout

**Preconditions**

- 10m compression for at least 30m.
- EMA21/48 trend aligned.
- ATR position supports expansion direction.

**Entry**

- At expansion confirmation / break of compression range.
- For Bilbo Box, immediate break beats retest historically.

**Invalidation**

- Failure back into box/range.
- Opposite boundary break.

**Targets**

- 0.5–1R for Bilbo Box.
- ATR level ladder and support/resistance for broader compression expansion.

### 13.5 Gap fill / midpoint fill

**Preconditions**

- Gap size known.
- Trend filter known: gap is counter-trend or pro-trend.
- Price rejects continuation or loses opening direction.

**Entry**

- Break of opening range toward gap.
- Failed breakout / rejection at supply/demand.
- PDC magnet confirmed by VWAP/ribbon/PO.

**Invalidation**

- Gap continues with trend and holds above/below key level.
- Ribbon strongly supports continuation.

**Targets**

- Gap midpoint first.
- Full gap/PDC second.

### 13.6 ORB continuation

**Preconditions**

- Opening range defined.
- Clear trend / VWAP / ribbon support.
- Avoid initial 10-minute randomness unless using a separate open trigger setup.

**Entry**

- Break and hold opening range high/low.
- Retest of OR boundary or trigger in trend.

**Invalidation**

- Close back inside OR.
- Loss/reclaim of EMA/ribbon level against trade.

**Targets**

- PM high/low, support/resistance, ATR trigger/GG, ±1 ATR.

### 13.7 Vomy / iVomy

**Preconditions**

- Ribbon flip/8-13 structure in direction.
- Trend confirmation or conviction arrow.
- Pullback into ribbon or reclaim/rejection at 8/13 EMA.

**Entry**

- Vomy short: 8/13 EMA rejection, bear flag breakdown, put trigger break.
- iVomy long: 8/13 EMA reclaim/hold, previous close hold, call trigger path.

**Invalidation**

- Reclaim/loss of 13 EMA against trade.
- Failed ribbon flip / sideways market.

**Targets**

- Trigger, 50%, 61.8, ±1 ATR, support/resistance/gap fill.

### 13.8 ±1 ATR RTM

**Preconditions**

- Price extended to ±1 ATR or far from ribbon/EMA.
- PO extreme/leaving extreme, divergence, exhaustion, fired squeeze, or TICK extreme.

**Entry**

- Confirmation of rejection/failed continuation.
- Safer after PO/ribbon confirms, not at first touch in a trend day.

**Invalidation**

- Clean continuation through ±1 ATR with trend/ribbon support.
- No exhaustion; volume expands with trend.

**Targets**

- Next ATR level back inward, VWAP, ribbon/EMA, PDC.

### 13.9 4h PO / OpEx rollover put plan

**Preconditions**

- 4h PO peak ≥80 then crosses below 80.
- OpEx Friday or post-OpEx 1–5 day window preferred.
- Weekly/monthly ATR position ≥0.618 strengthens.

**Entry**

- Use rejection/rollover confirmation; avoid expecting immediate dump.
- Prefer longer-dated puts if playing 10d tail.

**Invalidation**

- 4h PO reclaims/rises; price holds trend/ribbon and no downside follow-through.

**Targets**

- 1% / 1.5% / 2% drawdown bands over 5–10d, plus ATR levels and daily EMA21.

### 13.10 Call→put morning reversal

**Preconditions**

- Call trigger hit before noon.
- Price crosses below PDC.
- Put trigger reached before noon.
- 1h PO state assessed.

**Entry**

- At put-trigger touch/retest or after PDC loss confirms.

**Invalidation**

- PDC reclaim with failure to extend lower.
- Bullish 1h expansion reduces downside continuation.

**Targets**

- Downside GG open/complete.
- PDC recovery possibility must be respected.
- -1 ATR only ~18.5% overall; do not assume.

## 15. Caveats and data-quality notes

1. **Research, not advice**: all stats are historical SPY research, not guarantees.
2. **SPY vs SPX**: backtests are on SPY; SPX options execution/liquidity/settlement differ.
3. **1h PO caveat**: hourly Phase Oscillator has TradingView mismatch due to extended-hours ATR inflation. Use 60m PO because it tested predictive, but mark uncertainty.
4. **Bilbo GG audit warning**: unified KB flags several Bilbo claims as `needs_code_fix`; verify reruns before sizing around exact percentages.
5. **1d Bilbo Box underpowered**: daily Bilbo Box sample n=279; bullish drift drives much of higher-TF bull edge.
6. **Upward drift bias**: 25-year SPY history favors bull breaks on higher timeframes.
7. **Extracted Satyland doctrine**: some Saty claims come from OCR/vision extraction of screenshots. Use as doctrine/terminology, not validated quant.
8. **Avoid example contamination**: example chart tickers, dates, visible panels are not rules unless doctrine text explicitly states them. [Source: `/root/satyland/kb/glossary.md#applicability-vs-example-only`]
9. **Conflicting close→trigger number**: `studies_reference.md` says close→±Trigger reached on 99.2% of days in either direction; `README.md` and older `KNOWLEDGE.md` cite 80% in a level-to-level table. Prefer `studies_reference.md` for current compact stats and preserve the conflict if precision matters.
10. **Execution matters**: options spreads, 0DTE greeks, slippage, IV, and strike selection can dominate the theoretical underlying move edge.

## 17. Compact live-analysis template

Use this when Mr. Pedro sends “SPX” or asks for a live plan:

```text

## 18. One-screen decision hierarchy

1. **Higher TF**: daily/4h/1h PO, daily EMA21 distance, weekly/monthly ATR extension.
2. **Day levels**: PDC, trigger, 38.2, 50, 61.8, full ATR, PM high/low, OR high/low, VWAP.
3. **Regime**: trend, compression, chop, event/OpEx.
4. **Setup**: GG, Bilbo GG, trigger box, gap, ORB, Vomy/iVomy, RTM, compression/Bilbo Box.
5. **Entry**: exact candle/level condition; no vague chasing.
6. **Invalidation**: exact level and close requirement.
7. **Targets**: nearest level-to-level ladder; partials; time expectation.
8. **Risk**: late-day decay, 0DTE Greeks, audit caveats, no-trade option.

If none of the above identifies a clean setup: **do nothing**.
